  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 9, 2025</p>
  
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy describes how trizum ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, 
    and protects your information when you use our expense splitting application 
    ("Service").
  </p>
  
  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  
  <h3>1.1 Information You Provide</h3>
  <p>When you use trizum, you may provide the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Party Information:</strong> Names of parties/groups, descriptions, and currency preferences</li>
    <li><strong>Participant Information:</strong> Names of participants in your expense groups, and optionally phone numbers (if you choose to share them in your settings) and profile pictures</li>
    <li><strong>Expense Data:</strong> Details about expenses including amounts, dates, descriptions, who paid, and how expenses are split</li>
    <li><strong>Media Files:</strong> Photos and receipts you attach to expenses</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>1.2 Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Technical Data:</strong> Device information, browser type, operating system, and usage patterns</li>
    <li><strong>Error Reports:</strong> When errors occur, we may collect diagnostic information through Sentry to help improve the Service</li>
    <li><strong>Sync Data:</strong> Information about data synchronization between your devices</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  
  <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Provide and maintain the Service</li>
    <li>Enable real-time synchronization of your expense data across your devices</li>
    <li>Allow collaboration with other participants in your expense groups</li>
    <li>Calculate balances and settlements between participants</li>
    <li>Store your data locally on your device for offline access</li>
    <li>Identify and fix technical issues through error reporting</li>
    <li>Improve and optimize the Service</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>3. Data Storage and Synchronization</h2>
  
  <h3>3.1 Local Storage</h3>
  <p>
    trizum uses an offline-first architecture. Your data is primarily stored locally 
    on your device using IndexedDB. This means your expense data is available even 
    when you're offline.
  </p>
  
  <h3>3.2 Cloud Synchronization</h3>
  <p>
    To enable synchronization across your devices and collaboration with others, 
    your data is synchronized via WebSocket connections to our servers. This 
    synchronization allows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time updates when multiple users access the same expense group</li>
    <li>Access to your data from multiple devices</li>
    <li>Automatic conflict resolution when changes occur simultaneously</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>3.3 Data Encryption</h3>
  <p>
    Data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using secure 
    WebSocket connections (WSS). However, please note that data stored on our 
    servers is not end-to-end encrypted and may be accessible to us for the 
    purposes of providing the Service and synchronization.
  </p>
  
  <h3>3.4 Access Model</h3>
  <p>
    trizum uses a peer-to-peer sharing model based on link-based access. Expense 
    groups (parties) are accessed through shareable links. Anyone who has access 
    to a link can view and modify the expense group associated with that link. 
    Please keep your expense group links secure and only share them with trusted 
    individuals.
  </p>
  
  <h2>4. Data Sharing and Access</h2>
  
  <h3>4.1 Sharing with Other Users</h3>
  <p>
    trizum uses a peer-to-peer sharing model. When you create an expense group 
    (party), it is accessible to anyone who has the link to that group. This 
    means that anyone with access to the link can view and modify all information 
    in that expense group, including participant names, expenses, media files, 
    and any optional phone numbers if shared. Please keep your expense group 
    links secure and only share them with people you trust.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Important:</strong> We do not require user accounts or authentication. 
    Access to expense groups is controlled solely by link sharing. If someone 
    gains access to a link, they can access the associated expense group.
  </p>
  
  <h3>4.2 Third-Party Services</h3>
  <p>We use the following third-party services:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Sentry:</strong> We use Sentry for error tracking and performance 
      monitoring. Sentry may collect technical information about errors and 
      performance issues. For more information, see 
      <a href="https://sentry.io/privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sentry's Privacy Policy</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>4.3 Legal Requirements</h3>
  <p>
    We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid 
    legal requests, such as court orders or subpoenas.
  </p>
  
  <h2>5. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
  
  <h3>5.1 Access and Deletion</h3>
  <p>
    You can access, modify, or delete your data at any time through the Service. 
    To delete your data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Delete individual expenses or participants within the app</li>
    <li>Delete entire expense groups</li>
    <li>Clear your local data by clearing your browser's IndexedDB storage</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>5.2 Data Portability</h3>
  <p>
    Your data is stored in a standard format. You can export your data through 
    the Service's export functionality, if available.
  </p>
  
  <h3>5.3 Opt-Out of Error Reporting</h3>
  <p>
    Error reporting through Sentry is only active in production builds. If you 
    prefer not to have error data collected, you may use a development build 
    or contact us to discuss alternatives.
  </p>
  
  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  
  <p>
    We retain your data to provide the Service. Data stored locally on your device 
    will persist until you delete it or clear your browser's storage. Data stored 
    on our synchronization servers is retained to enable synchronization across 
    devices and collaboration between users.
  </p>
  <p>
    All data that has not been accessed for 12 months may be automatically 
    deleted from our synchronization servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    When you delete an expense group or its data through the Service, it will be 
    removed from our synchronization servers. Please note that this policy may 
    change in the future with the introduction of paid plans and freemium limits.
  </p>
  
  <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
  
  <p>
    trizum is not intended for users under the age of 18. We do not knowingly 
    collect personal information from children. If you believe we have collected 
    information from a child, please contact us immediately.
  </p>
  
  <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
  
  <p>
    Your data may be stored and processed in servers located outside your country 
    of residence. By using the Service, you consent to the transfer of your data 
    to these locations.
  </p>
  
  <h2>9. Security</h2>
  
  <p>
    We implement reasonable security measures to protect your data, including:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Encrypted data transmission (WSS)</li>
    <li>Secure server infrastructure</li>
    <li>Regular security assessments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. While we strive 
    to protect your data, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
  </p>
  
  <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of 
    any material changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and 
    updating the "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy 
    Policy periodically for any changes.
